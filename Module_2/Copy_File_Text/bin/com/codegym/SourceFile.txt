At least 16,700 people have died of coronavirus in the United States -- nearly half of them in New York state. 
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, of the more than 466,390 total confirmed cases nationwide, 
about 162,000 are in New York state. That means it has more reported cases than any country in the world.
The US is set to reach its highest daily number of deaths on or around Sunday, according to models by the prominent Institute for 
Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It estimated that 60,415 in the US would die of coronavirus by August, assuming social distancing policies continue through May. 
That projection is down from the 82,000 it predicted earlier this week.
Antibody tests are used in other clinical scenarios, said Dr. Colleen Kraft, associate chief medical officer of 
Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Soon, she said, we'll learn whether a coronavirus antibody test "tells us that somebody 
can go back to work, for instance, tells us that somebody is no longer infectious, and tells us that somebody cannot get the virus again."
As officials begin discussing what it would take for the US to reopen, there could be "merit" to the idea of 
Americans carrying certificates of immunity that prove they have tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, Fauci said.
Fauci told CNN, "It's one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the 
vulnerable people are and not."
Social distancing appears to be working, officials say
Americans need to continue to adhere to social distancing guidelines throughout the coming holiday weekend, Fauci said Friday.
