            The <b>Vietnamese</b> Wikipedia initially went online in November 2002, with a front page and an article about the Internet Society. </br>
            The project received little attention and did not begin to receive significant contributions until it was "restarted" </br>
            in October 2003[3] and the newer, Unicode-capable <b>MediaWiki</b> software was installed soon after.</br>
        </p>

        <p>    By August 2008, the <span>Vietnamese Wikipedia</span> had grown to more than <b>50,000 articles</b> – a milestone it achieved on August 26 –</br>
        approximately 432 of which were created by bots.[4] By the time the project reached the 100,000-article milestone on September 12, 2009, </br>
            bot-generated articles made up around 5% of its corpus.[5] Short articles are designated "stubs"; such articles number in the tens of thousands and include most of the bot-generated articles.</p>

        <p>  An experimental Wikipedia edition in the obsolete chữ Nôm script began in <b>October 2006</b> at the Wikimedia Incubator.[7] It was deleted in April 2010.[8] </br>
            An unrelated wiki encyclopedia project, VinaWiki, transliterates <span>Vietnamese Wikipedia</span> articles into chữ Nôm as part of a project to revive the script.[9]

            The volunteer-led Vietnam Wikimedians User Group supports the development of the Vietnamese Wikipedia and other Vietnamese-language Wikimedia projects. </br>It gained formal recognition as a Wikimedia user group on 28 August 2018.[10]
